# Roblox Anti-AFK (VB .Net)

By Hevanafa, 7th May 2023

## Requirements
- Visual Studio Community 2019 (or any Visual Studio that supports VB .Net)
- AutoIt v3

## How it works
- This app will beep 10 seconds before it activates the AutoIt script.
- The script will activate Roblox, press <kbd>Esc</kbd>, and then minimise it automatically.
- The interval is 7 minutes, so you don't have to worry about getting kicked due to 20 minutes of being idle.

Keep in mind that there's still a tiny chance that Roblox will lag & doesn't register the keyboard event due to lag.


## How to Change the Sound

You can change the sound, but since I'm using the built-in .Net `SoundPlayer`, it only supports WAV files.

Simply change the `sound_file$` property in `Form1.vb`.
